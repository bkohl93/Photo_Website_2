"I grew up in rural southeastern Ohio, surrounded by farmland. As time went on, 
that farmland got smaller, taken up by industrial centers and housing developments. 
My photography documents the changing American landscape, starting with the rural 
land that is familiar to me. My work follows the tradition of The New Topographics, 
implementing a deadpan style of documentation, lacking emotion and opinion.  

I strive for objectivity and compose my images in a direct manner. I seek to 
document what I find, exactly as I find it, not changing it to fit a picture 
I have in my mind; because of this I do very little post production. While I 
am out driving around, I get most of the inspiration for my photographs. 
Sometimes I will drive to places I have never been, often getting a little lost."
